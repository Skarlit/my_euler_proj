<p>If we sum up all multiple of 3 and all multiple of 5 up to 1000, we have a set of double counted numbers. The number that are multiple of both 3 and 5</p>
<p>Note that $gcd(5, 3) = 1$, therefore  $x | 15 \iff x | 3$ and $x | 5$. Meaning that 15 is the generator of that double counted set.</p>
<p>So $S = 3 \times (1 + 2 + \cdots \lfloor\frac{1000}{3}\lfloor) + 5 \times (1 + 2 + \cdots \lfloor\frac{1000}{5}\rfloor) - 15 \times (1 + 2 + \cdots \lfloor\frac{1000}{15}\lfloor)$</p>
