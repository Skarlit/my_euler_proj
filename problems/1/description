<p>If we sum up all multiple of 3 and all multiple of 5 up to 1000, we have a set of double counted numbers. The number that are multiple of both 3 and 5</p>
<p>Note that gcd(5, 3) = 1, therefore  x | 15 iff  x | 3 and x | 5. Meaning that 15 is the generator of that double counted set.</p>
<p>So S = 3 * (1 + 2 + .... floor(1000 / 3)) + 5 * (1 + 2 + .... floor(1000 / 5) - 15 * (1 + 2 + ... floor(1000/15))</p>
